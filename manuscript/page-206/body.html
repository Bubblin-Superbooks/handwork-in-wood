<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The <em>rabbeting-</em> or <em>rebating-plane</em>, Fig. 112, is designed for use in cutting out a rectangular recess, such as the rabbet on the back of the picture-frames. In line with the right hand corner of the cutter is a removable spur to score the wood so that the shaving which follows may be cut out clean and not torn out. With the addition of a guiding fence it is called a <em>filletster</em>. This may be used on either the right or left side. In the form shown in Fig. 112, there is also a depth gage.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In using this plane see that the corner of the cutter is in line with the sole, and that both it and the spur are sharp. Set the fence and the stop at the desired width and depth of the rabbet. At the first stroke the spur will score the width. This and every stroke should be taken as evenly and carefully as if it were the only one. In the effort to keep the fence pressed close to the side of the wood, the tendency is to tilt the plane over. This causes the very opposite effect from that desired, for the spur</p></div> </div>
