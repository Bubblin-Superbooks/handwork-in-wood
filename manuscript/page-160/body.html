Using a Router-Plane.</p><p>The <em>dowel-pointer</em>, Fig. 123, is a convenient tool for removing the sharp edges from the ends of dowel pins. It is held in a brace. The cutter is adjustable and is removable for sharpening.</p><p>The <em>cornering tool</em>, Fig. 124, is a simple device for rounding sharp corners. A cutter at each end cuts both ways so that it can be used with the grain without changing the position of the work. The depth of the cut is fixed.</p><p>Fig. 123. Dowel-Pointer.
