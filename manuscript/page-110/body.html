If the edge be dull, it will feel smooth: if it be sharp, and if care be taken, it will score the skin a little, not enough to cut thru, but just enough to be felt.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "87%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/079-353.png" /><p>Fig. 79. Testing the Sharpness of a Chisel.</p><p>The <em>gouge</em> is a form of chisel, the blade of which is concave, and hence the edge curved. When the bevel is on the outside, the common form, it is called an outside bevel gouge or simply a "gouge," Fig. 80; if the bevel is on the inside, it is called an inside bevel, or inside ground, or scribing-gouge, or paring-gouge, Fig. 81.3</p><p>Footnote 3: Another confusing nomenclature (Goss gives the name "inside gouges" to those with the cutting edge on the inside, and "outside gouges" to those with the cutting edge on the outside. )</p></div> </div>
