The disadvantages are the appearance and, in some cases, the insecurity.</p><p>The holding power of nails may be increased by driving them into the wood at other than a right angle, especially where several nails unite two pieces of wood. By driving some at one inclination and some at another, they bind the pieces of wood together with much greater force than when driven in straight.</p><p>The term brads was once confined to small finishing nails, but is now used for all finishing nails, in distinction from common or flat-headed nails. The heads are made round instead of flat so that they may be set easily with a nailset and the hole filled with a plug, or, where the wood is to be painted, with putty. They are used for interior finishing and other nice work.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>Tacks</em>, Fig. 227, vary in size and shape according to</p></div> </div>
