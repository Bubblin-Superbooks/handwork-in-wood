Any longer thread would only weaken the screw where it most needs strength, near the head, and it does not need friction with the piece thru which it passes.</p><p>The size of screws is indicated by their length in inches, and by the diameter of the wire from which they are made, using the standard screw-gage, Fig. 220. They vary in size from No. 0 (less than 1⁄16" to No. 30 (more than 7⁄16" in diameter, and in length from ¼" to 6". ) )</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The following is a good general rule for the use of screws: make the hole in the piece thru which the screw passes, large enough for the screw to slip thru easily. Countersink this hole enough to allow the head to sink flush with the surface. Make the hole in the piece into which the screw goes small enough for the thread of the screw to catch tight. Then all the strength exerted in driving, goes toward drawing the pieces together, not in overcoming friction. The hole must be deep enough,</p></div> </div>
