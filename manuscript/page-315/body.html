A joint to resist cross strain is stronger when scarfed in the direction of the strain than across it. No. 7 is the plan, not elevation, of a joint to receive vertical cross strain.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "93%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/264-04.png" /><p>Fig. 264-4 Spliced for compression</p><img class="overlay center" width = "93%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/264-05.png" /><p>Fig. 264-5 Spliced for tension</p><img class="overlay center" width = "92%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/264-06.png" /><p>Fig. 264-6 Spliced and Tabled</p><img class="overlay center" width = "81%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/264-07.png" /><p>Fig. 264-7 Spliced for cross strain</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
