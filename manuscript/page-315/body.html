<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">The best natural stones are found near Hot Springs, Arkansas. The fine white ones are called Arkansas stones, and the coarser ones Washita stones. The latter are better for ordinary woodworking tools. The <em>India oilstone</em>, an artificial stone, Fig. 77,  , cuts even more quickly than the natural stones. It is made in several grades of coarseness. The medium grade is recommended for ordinary shop use. Oil is used on oilstones for the same purpose as water on a grindstone. When an oilstone becomes hollow or uneven by use, it may be trued by rubbing it on a flat board covered with sharp sand, or on sandpaper tacked over a block of wood.</p><p><em>Slipstones</em>, Fig. 225, are small oilstones, made into various shapes in order to fit different tools, as gouges, the bits of molding-planes, etc.</p><p><em>Files</em> are used for sharpening saws, augers, scrapers, etc. See above.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
