Edge and Wedge Action Across the Grain.</p><p>Ordinarily a cutting tool should be so applied that the face nearest the material lies as nearly as possible in the direction of the cut desired, sufficient clearance being necessary to insure contact of the actual edge.</p><p>There are two methods of using edge tools: one, the chisel or straight cut, by direct pressure; the other, the knife or sliding cut.</p><p>The straight cut, Fig. 63, takes place when the tool is moved into the material at right angles to the cutting edge. Examples are: the action of metalworking tools and planing machines, rip-sawing, turning, planing (when the plane is held parallel to the edge of the board being planed), and chiseling, when the chisel is pushed directly in line with its length.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The knife or sliding cut, Fig. 64, takes place when</p></div> </div>
