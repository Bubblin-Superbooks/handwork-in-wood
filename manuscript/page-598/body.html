The face may then be gaged with a series of lines so that every other space will be equal to the required thickness of each slat, and the alternate spaces be just sufficient for the saw kerf and dressing. The slats may then be ripped apart and dressed to size.</p><p>Or a long strip may be planed to thickness and width and then be sawn up and finished to the proper lengths. For example, in a mitered picture-frame it may be convenient to plane up two pieces, each one long enough to make one long side and one short side.</p><p>In fitting up framed structures each part when fitted should be distinctly marked, so that there may be no confusion in assembling.</p><blockquote class="  "><p><em>Where practicable secure the same conditions of grain</em></blockquote></div> </div>
