<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  "><em>possible, allow for shrinkage without prejudice to construction.</em></p></blockquote><p>The most obvious illustration of this principle is panel construction. In a panel, the frame, which is comparatively narrow, follows the principal dimensions, and hence does not seriously shrink or swell itself. But the panel, which is grooved into the frame can shrink or swell without harm to the general structure.</p><p>In a gained joint, as in a case of shelves, Fig. 266, No.  , the gain in the uprights does not extend quite to the front of the shelves, and there is a corresponding slight shoulder at the front end of the shelf, so that if the shelf and support shrink unevenly, no gap will be apparent.</p><p>A drawing-board, Fig. 280,  , is so made that it can shrink or swell without losing its flatness. Shingles when properly laid, can shrink or swell without the roof leaking.</p><blockquote class="  "><p><em>Where</em></blockquote></div> </div>
