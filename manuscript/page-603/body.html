So when a number of like pieces are to be gaged, all the parts requiring the same setting should be gaged before the gage is reset for another gaging. This is a great saving of time and insures accuracy.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In making a number of like parts, if they are not too large much of the work can often be done in one piece</p></div> </div>
