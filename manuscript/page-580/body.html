<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>If there are two drawers, a double runner lies between, and is gained into the middles of the back rail and the stringer, and on it is a guide for both drawers, equal in width to the partition between the drawers. The drawers should run easily in their proper places. In order to insure this, the drawer should be slightly narrower than the opening which receives it. A little French chalk, rubbed on the sides and runners, makes the running smoother. Sometimes the opening for a drawer is cut out of the front rail, as in Fig. 296. In this case the drawer runners are supported between the front and back rails, into which they may be gained.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "94.44520840972986%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/296-500.png" /></div> </div>
