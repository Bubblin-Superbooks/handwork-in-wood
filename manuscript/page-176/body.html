<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">one. The filing is continued, with one, two, or three strokes, for each tooth, as the case may require, or just until each tooth is sharp.</p><p>In filing a crosscut-saw, the file is held pointing upward and toward the point of the saw. The file should cut in the direction of the set. The angle of the cutting edge is determined by the horizontal inclination of the file to the blade; the angle of the point is determined by the perpendicular inclination of the file to the blade. Finally the sides of the teeth are rubbed lightly with a slipstone to remove the wire edge. It should always be remembered that a saw is an edge tool, and its edges are as liable to injury as any edges.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
