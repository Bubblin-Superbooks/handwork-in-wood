Carver's mallets are often turned from one piece, hammer and head on one axis.</p><p><em>Nailsets</em>, Fig. 165, are made with hardened points, but softer butts, so that the hammer will not be injured. They were formerly made square when nail heads were square, but now round ones are common. To obviate slipping, some have "cup points," that is, with a concave tip, and some spur points.</p><p>Fig. 165. Using a Nailset.</p><p>To keep the nailset in its place on the nail-head it may be held closely against the third finger of the left hand, which rests on the wood close to the nail. When a nailset is lacking, the head of a brad, held nearly flat, may be used. But care is necessary to avoid bruising the wood.</p><hr class="section"><p>.
