<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p><em>No. 37. A dovetail mortise-and-tenon</em> is a thru mortise-and-tenon beveled on one side so as to form half a dovetail. The corresponding side of the mortise is also beveled and made wide enough so that when the tenon is pressed well up against its beveled side a wedge may be driven into the space left on the straight side. It is used to tenon a beam into a post especially where the post is fixed against a wall. It is also used in machinery frames which are made of wood.</p><p>Fig. 266-37 Dovetail mortise and tenon</p><p><em>No. 38. A pinned mortise-and-tenon</em> is one in which a pin is driven thru holes bored thru the mortised beam and thru the tenon to keep them from drawing apart. It is used in heavy framing as in bridges, in wagon-making, in window-sash, etc.</p></div> </div>
