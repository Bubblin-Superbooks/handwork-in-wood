<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p><em>No. 29. A gain joint</em> is a dado which runs only partly across one member, X. In order to make the edges of both members flush and to conceal the blind end of the gain, the corner of the other member, Y, is correspondingly notched out. In book shelves a gain gives a better appearance than a dado.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "73.1894022735607%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/266-29.png" /></div> </div>
