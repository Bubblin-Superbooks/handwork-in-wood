A wedged mortise-and-tenon joint</em> is a thru joint in which after the tenon is driven home, wedges are driven in between the tenon and the sides of the mortise. The wedges are dipped in glue or white lead before being inserted. The sides of the mortise may be slightly dovetailed. It is used to keep a tenon tightly fixed as in wheel spokes.</p><p>Fig. 266-34 Wedged mortise and tenon</p></div> </div>
