Column-Clamp.</p><p>Another method is to glue and clamp the pieces of the taboret together two by two, using blocks as shown in Fig. 258, <em>a</em>. Care should be taken to put the pressure of the handscrews as far out as possible so as to be sure that the outside of the joint closes. This method has the advantage that, as only one joint is glued at a time, the work can be done more deliberately. Moreover, if when three pairs of a six-sided taboret are together, the other three joints do not fit exactly, they can then be refitted.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Another method is to glue pieces of soft wood on the exterior of each pieces as shown in Fig. 258, <em>c</em>.
