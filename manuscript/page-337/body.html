Knife grooves are made in the waste for starting the saw as in the dado. Before sawing, the blind end of the gain is to be chiseled out for a little space so as to give play for the back-saw in cutting down to the required depth. To avoid sawing too deep at the blind end, the sawing and chiseling out of waste may be carried on alternately, a little at a \ , facilitates the cutting, and insures an even depth.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "48%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/251-200.png" /><p>Fig. 251.
