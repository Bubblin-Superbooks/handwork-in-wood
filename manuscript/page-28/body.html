Sawing Logs into Lengths.</p><p>All this seems simple enough in outline, but the actual execution requires considerable skill. Trees seldom stand quite vertical, there is danger of lodging in some other tree in thick woods, and it is therefore necessary to throw trees quite exactly. Some men become so expert at this that they can plant a stake and drive it into the ground by the falling trunk as truly as if they hit it with a maul. On the other hand, serious accidents often happen in falling trees. Most of them come from "side winders," i. e., the falling of smaller trees struck by the felled trees.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">After "falling" a tree, the sawyers mark off and saw the trunk into log lengths, Fig. 6, paying due attention</p></div> </div>
