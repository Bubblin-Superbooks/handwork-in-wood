<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Single Support. <em>b</em>. Double Support.</p><p><em>Wall book-shelves</em>, Fig. 277, <em>plate-racks</em>, etc., are simply compound brackets. The shelf is the essential piece, the sides take the place of the supports, and the back is often reduced to strips merely wide enough to give rigidity.</p><p>The shelves may be either gained into the supports, Fig. 266, No.  , or a keyed mortise-and-tenon may be used, Fig. 277. In the latter case the back strip may have a short barefaced blind tenon which is mortised into the upright, Fig. 278. It also fits into a rabbet on the upper back side of the shelf. Made in this way the shelves can be knocked down easily.</p></div> </div>
