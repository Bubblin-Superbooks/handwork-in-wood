Otherwise the appearance is excellent. The top may be paneled into the sides, Fig. 285, H. This has a good appearance if the sides are mitered and ledged but not if the sides are butted or dadoed, because then the groove for the top shows.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "93.33516685001834%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/285-600.png" /><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Any of these lids may be made removable or hinged,</p></div> </div>
