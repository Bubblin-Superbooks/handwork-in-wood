A horse hitched to the end of the chain hauls up the log, which is guided by the "send-up men" with their cant-hooks.</p><p>Once piled the logs are "<em>scaled</em>," that is measured in order to compute the number of board feet in them, Fig. 9. The scaler generally has an assistant, for logs in large piles must be measured at both ends in order to determine which is the top, the body of the log being out of sight. When measured each end of the log is stamped with a hammer with the owner's mark, by which it can afterward be identified. Here the logs rest and the felling and skidding continue until deep snow falls and then the sleigh haul begins.</p></div> </div>
