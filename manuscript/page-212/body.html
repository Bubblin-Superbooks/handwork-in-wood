Opposite this and under the graduation on the edge representing the run in feet, will be found the length of the rafter; e.g., a rafter having a run of 12' with a ¼ pitch, is 13' 5" long, one with a run of 11' and a ⅓ pitch, is 13' 28⁄12", one with a run of 7' and a ⅝ pitch, is 11' 26⁄12" long, etc.</p><p>When the run is in inches, the readings are for 1⁄12 of the run in feet: e.g., a rafter with a run of 12" and a ¼ pitch is 135⁄12", one with a run of 11" and a ⅓ pitch, is 133⁄12". Where the run is in both feet and inches, find the feet and the inches separately; and add together; e.g., a rafter with a run of 11' 6", and a ½ pitch, is 15' 68⁄12" + 86⁄12" = 16' 32⁄12".</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The <em>lumberman's board-rule</em>, Fig. 199.
