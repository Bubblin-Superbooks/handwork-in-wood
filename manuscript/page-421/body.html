The drawers should run easily in their proper places. In order to insure this, the drawer should be slightly narrower than the opening which receives it. A little French chalk, rubbed on the sides and runners, makes the running smoother. Sometimes the opening for a drawer is cut out of the front rail, as in Fig. 296. In this case the drawer runners are supported between the front and back rails, into which they may be gained.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "95%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/296-500.png" /><p>Fig. 296.
