<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 267-41 Double mortise and tenon</p><p><em>No. 42. A haunched mortise-and-tenon</em> is made by cutting away part of the tenon so that that part of it will be much shorter than the rest. The haunch gives the tenon great lateral strength and saves cutting so large a mortise hole. It is used in panel construction, as where the rails are joined to the stiles of doors.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "68.40672493175244%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/267-42.png" /></div> </div>
