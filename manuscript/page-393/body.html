<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">embellished by <em>chamfering</em>. A chamfer is a surface produced by cutting away an arris. It differs from a bevel in that a bevel inclines all the way to the next arris, while a chamfer makes a new arris, Fig. 271. A thru chamfer extends the whole length or width of a piece, while a stop chamfer extends only part way. For the laying out of a chamfer see  .</p><img class="overlay center" width = "92%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/271-400.png" /><p>Fig. 271. Difference Between Chamfer and Bevel.</p><p>Thru chamfering is best done with a plane, Fig. 272. For this purpose the piece may be held in the bench-vise and the plane tipped to the proper angle, or the piece may be held in a handscrew which in turn is held in the vise as in Fig. 175. The chamfers with the grain should be planed before those across the grain.</p><p>Fig. 272.
