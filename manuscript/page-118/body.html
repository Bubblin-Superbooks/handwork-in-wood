The outline of the blade is tapered in width from handle to point; it is thicker also at the heel (the handle end than at the point; its thickness also tapers from the teeth to the back. All these tapers gives stiffness where it is most needed. It is made wide for the sake of giving steadiness in sawing. The fact that it is thinner at the back than along the teeth gives it clearance in passing back and forth in the kerf, but the friction is still great, especially in sawing soft or damp wood. To avoid this binding still further, the teeth are "set" alternately one to one side and the next to the other, and so on. )</p><img class="overlay center" width = "94%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/087-600.png" /><p>Fig. 87.
