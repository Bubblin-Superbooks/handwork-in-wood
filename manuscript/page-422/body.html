<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>For fastening the top to the table rails, several methods are used. The top may be screwed to the rails by the screws passing thru the rails themselves either straight up, Fig. 297, A, or diagonally from the inside, B, or thru blocks or angle irons, C, which are screwed to the inside of the rails, or thru buttons, or panel irons, D, which are free to move in a groove cut near the top of the rail. The last method is the best because it allows for the inevitable shrinkage and swelling of the top.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "91%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/297-600.png" /><p>Fig. 297. Methods of attaching Table Top to Rails.</p><p><em>Chairs</em> may be so simplified in form as to be possible for the amateur to construct. The two front legs and the rail and stretcher between them offer little difficulty because the angles are square.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The two back legs, may, for the purpose of simplification, be kept parallel to each other and at right angles to the seat rails between them, as in Fig.</p></div> </div>
