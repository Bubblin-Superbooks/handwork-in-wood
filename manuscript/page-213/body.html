This adapts it to work with curved outlines. It is a sort of regulated draw-shave. It is sometimes made of iron with an adjustable mouth, which is a convenient form for beginners to use, and is easy to sharpen. The <em>pattern-makers spokeshave</em>, Fig. 119, which has a wooden frame, is better suited to more careful work. The method of using the spokeshave is shown in Fig. 120.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "90.66510817748441%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/118-119-600.png" /><pre><code>          Fig. 119.
