Lumberman's Board Rule.</p><p>The <em>try-square</em>, Fig. 200, which is most commonly used for measuring the accuracy of right angles, is also convenient for testing the width of a board at various places along its length, for making short measurements, and as a guide in laying out lines with a pencil or knife at right angles to a surface or edge. The sizes are various and are indicated by the length of the blade. A convenient size for the individual bench and for ordinary use has a blade 6" long. It is also well to have in the shop one large one with a 12" blade.</p><p>Fig. 200. Try-Square.</p><p>Fig. 201. Miter-Square.</p><p>Fig. 202. Sliding-T Bevel.</p></div> </div>
