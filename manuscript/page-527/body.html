They are of poor quality, and the page enlargements are not much improved. These pages have been kept to preserve the original layout, and because they have been linked to from various places in the book. For the convenience of readers, the 75 diagrams have been individually enlarged, repaired where necessary, and inserted after their relevant, numbered, descriptions in the text (above), with links to them from the added lists at the tops of the original pages.</p><blockquote><p>Fig. 264.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
