<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The primitive celt, which was hardly more than a wedge, has been differentiated into three modern hand tools, the <em>chisel</em>, see above,  , the <em>ax</em>, Fig. 139, and the <em>adze</em>, Fig. 141.</p><p>The <em>ax</em> has also been differentiated into the <em>hatchet</em>, with a short handle, for use with one hand, while the ax-handle is long, for use with two hands. Its shape is an adaption to its manner of use. It is oval in order to be strongest in the direction of the blow and also in order that the axman may feel and guide the direction of the blade. The curve at the end is to avoid the awkward raising of the left hand at the moment of striking the blow, and the knob keeps it from slipping thru the hand. In both ax and hatchet there is a two-beveled edge. This is for the sake of facility in cutting into the wood at any angle.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">There are two principal forms, the common ax and the two bitted ax, the latter used chiefly in lumbering.</p></div> </div>
