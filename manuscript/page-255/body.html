<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">top of the bench, Fig. 169, but a better plan is to have the top of it no higher than the bench-top, Fig. 166. Then the light on the bench is not obscured, and when a flat top is needed for large work it can readily be had by removing the tools. Elaborate benches with lock drawers are also much used in the shops of large city schools.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "89.58282402314305%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/168-400.png" /></div> </div>
