<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">holes (say 1" in diameter are bored. These run parallel to the floor when the board is in place, and receive the end of the tool-holder. The tool-holder consists of four parts: (1 a strip C, 1½" thick, and as wide as the widest plane-bit to be ground. The forward end is beveled on one side; the back end is rounded to fit the holes in the main board A. Its length is determined by the distance from the edge of the tool being ground to the most convenient hole in A, into which the rear end is to be inserted. It is better to use as high a hole as convenient, so that as the grindstone wears down, the stick will still be serviceable; (2 a strip, D, of the same width as A and ⅞" thick, and 15" to 18" long; (3 a cleat, E, ⅝" × ¾", nailed across D; (4 a rectangular loop of wrought iron or brass, F, which passes around the farther end of the two strips, C and D, and is fastened loosely to D by staples or screws. ) ) ) ) )</p><p>Fig. 222.
