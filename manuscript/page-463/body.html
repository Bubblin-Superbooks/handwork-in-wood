Deduct from this 1⁄16" and square a fine pencil-line across the face and opposite side. This line will be the inside of the hole for the wedge, and the 1⁄16" is deducted to make sure that the key wedges against the mortised member. On the upper surface of the tenon, lay off toward the end the width of the wedge at this point, A B, Fig. 252, and square across. On the under surface, lay off the width of the wedge at this point, C D, and square across.</p><p>Gage the sides of the wedge hole on both upper and lower surfaces of the tenon.
