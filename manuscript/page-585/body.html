<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>For the making of the table top see edge-to-edge joint,  , then sand, first with No. 1, then with No. 00 sandpaper, finish the edges carefully, and attach to the frame.</p><p>For fastening the top to the table rails, several methods are used. The top may be screwed to the rails by the screws passing thru the rails themselves either straight up, Fig. 297, A, or diagonally from the inside, B, or thru blocks or angle irons, C, which are screwed to the inside of the rails, or thru buttons, or panel irons, D, which are free to move in a groove cut near the top of the rail. The last method is the best because it allows for the inevitable shrinkage and swelling of the top.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "90.1718412581999%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/297-600.png" /></div> </div>
