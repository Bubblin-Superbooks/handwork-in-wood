Methods of Attaching Box Bottoms.</p><p><em>The Lids of Boxes.</em> The simplest form is a full flat cover, Fig. 285, A, which may be nailed or screwed to the box, as in packing cases. The cover may slide into a groove, Fig. 285, B, along the sides and into one end, the other end being lowered to admit it. The cover may have cleats on its underside, Fig. 285, C, which fit just inside the box and keep the top in place. The cleats also prevent the top from warping. This is a common Japanese construction, even in fine boxes. The Japanese tie the top on with a tape or ribbon.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The lid may be boxed, Fig. 285, D, that is, portions</p></div> </div>
