The ends of flooring boards are also slightly beveled so as to make a tight fit on the upper side.</p><blockquote><p><em>Select the simplest form of joint and use the smallest number of abutments (bearing surfaces possible, because the more complicated the joint or the greater the number of bearing surfaces, the less likelihood there is of a sound and inexpensive construction.</em> ) </p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Illustrations of this principle are as follows: Usually a single mortise-and-tenon joint is better than a double</p></div> </div>
