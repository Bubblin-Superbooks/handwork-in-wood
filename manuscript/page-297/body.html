They are used for describing circles and arcs, for spacing, for measuring, for subdividing distances, and for scribing. In scribing a line parallel with a given outline, one leg follows the given edge, or outline, and the point of the other, marks the desired line. Used in this way they are very convenient for marking out chamfers, especially on curved edges, a sharp pencil being substituted for the steel point.</p><p>The <em>beam-compass</em>, Fig. 208, consists of two <em>trammel-points</em> running on a beam which may be made of any convenient length. It is used for describing large circles. A pencil may be attached to one point.</p><p><em>Calipers</em>, outside and inside, Figs. 209, 210, are necessary for the accurate gaging of diameters, as in wood-turning.</p><pre class="  "><code></pre></div> </div>
