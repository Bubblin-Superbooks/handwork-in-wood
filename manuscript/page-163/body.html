In a properly filed crosscut-saw a needle will slide between these two rows of teeth from one end of the saw to the other.</p><p>In action the points, especially their forward edges, cut or score the fibres of wood, and then the triangular elevation of wood left between the two rows of points is crumbled off by friction as the saw passes through. Thus it drops farther and farther into the cut. A crosscut-saw may be thought of as a series of knife points, arranged in two parallel rows. Ordinarily the angle of the "face" of each tooth with the line of the teeth is about 65Â°, and slightly steeper than the back of the tooth. The angle of the cutting edge of each tooth may be filed more acute when the saw is to be used for soft wood only.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">A crosscut-saw when used to rip a board, works slowly, for there is no chisel action to cut out the fibres</p></div> </div>
