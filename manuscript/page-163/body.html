<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The shape of the teeth is the result of experience in uniting a number of factors: as, strength of the individual tooth, the acuteness of the cutting angle, and the ease of sharpening. The steel of a saw is softer than that of a chisel, in order that it may be filed and set. Hence it is weaker and the edge cannot be so acute. A typical form of tooth is shown in Fig. 87, in which A is an edge view, B the side view, and C a cross section. The angle of each tooth covers 60Â°, one side, the "face", being at right angles to the line of the teeth. The cutting edge runs at right angles to the sides of the blade.</p><p>This arrangement works with entire success along the grain, but if a rip-saw is used to cut across the grain, since there is no provision for cutting thru the fibers, each tooth catches in them and tears them out, thus leaving a rough and jagged surface.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In the <em>crosscut-saw</em>, therefore, the teeth are filed to points, and the cutting edge is on the forward side of</p></div> </div>
