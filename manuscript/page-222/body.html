They are sharpened in the same way as auger-bits.</p><p><em>Foerstner bits</em>, Fig. 133, are peculiar in having no spur, but are centered by a sharp edge around the circumference. The size is indicated on the tang, in 16ths of an inch. They are useful in boring into end grain, and in boring part way into wood so thin that a spur would pierce thru. They can be sharpened only with special appliances.</p><p><em>Expansive-bits</em>, Fig. 134, are so made as to bore holes of different sizes by adjusting the movable nib and cutter. There are two sizes, the small one with two cutters, boring from ½" to 1½" and the large one with three cutters boring from ⅞" to 4". They are very useful on particular occasions, but have to be used with care.</p><p><em>Reamers</em>, Fig. 135, are used for enlarging holes already made. They are made square, half-round and six cornered in shape.</p></div> </div>
