Here the knuckle is set well out from the wood. (2 Where it is desired to have the hinged portion open flat and no more. Here the center of the pin is in line with the outside surface of the wood. This is less likely to rack the hinge than the other two positions. (3 Where it is desired to have the knuckle project as little as possible. ) ) )</p><p>Fig. 235.
