<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 266-29 Gain</p><p>A gain joint is laid out in the same way as the dado, except that the lines are not carried clear across the face of X, and only one edge is squared and gaged to the required depth. Knife grooves are made in the waste for starting the saw as in the dado. Before sawing, the blind end of the gain is to be chiseled out for a little space so as to give play for the back-saw in cutting down to the required depth. To avoid sawing too deep at the blind end, the sawing and chiseling out of waste may be carried on alternately, a little at a, facilitates the cutting, and insures an even depth.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "47.011622458542156%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/251-200.png" /><hr class="section"></div> </div>
