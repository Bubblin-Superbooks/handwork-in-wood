<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>BORING TOOLS.</p></blockquote><p>Some boring tools, like awls, force the material apart, and some, like augers, remove material.</p><p>The <em>brad-awl</em>, Fig. 125, is wedge-shaped, and hence care needs to be taken in using it to keep the edge across the grain so as to avoid splitting the wood, especially thin wood. The size is indicated by the length of the blade when new,â€”a stupid method. The awl is useful for making small holes in soft wood, and it can readily be sharpened by grinding.</p></div> </div>
