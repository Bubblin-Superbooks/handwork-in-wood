Paring-Chisel.  Fig. 67. Framing-Chisel.  Fig. 68. Mortise-Chisel.</p><p>The <em>paring-chisel</em>, Fig. 66, has a handle specially shaped to give control over its movements, and a long thin blade, which in the best form is beveled on the two edges to facilitate grooving. It is intended only for steady pressure with the hand and not for use with a mallet.</p><p>The <em>framing-chisel</em>, Fig. 67, is thick and heavy and was formerly much used in house framing. It is usually made with the handle fitting into a socket on the shank, in order to withstand the shock of heavy blows from the mallet.</p><p>The <em>mortise-chisel</em>, Fig. 68, is made abnormally thick to give the stiffness necessary for levering the waste out of mortises.</p></div> </div>
