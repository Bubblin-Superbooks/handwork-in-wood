Then the light on the bench is not obscured, and when a flat top is needed for large work it can readily be had by removing the tools. Elaborate benches with lock drawers are also much used in the shops of large city schools.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "144%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/168-400.png" /><p>Fig. 168.

They are now made with an automatic adjusting device by which the jaw and the face of the bench are kept parallel; (2 wooden vises with a horizontal jaw, guided by parallel runners, Fig. 166, and, (3 metal rapid-acting vises, Fig. 168. The latter are the most durable and in most respects more convenient. Special vises are also made for wood-carvers,</p></div> </div>
