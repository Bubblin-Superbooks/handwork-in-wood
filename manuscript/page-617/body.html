Among their water stains some of the best are: Flemish oak, weathered oak, walnut, silver gray, forest green, and mahogany, especially if the latter is modified with bichromate of potash. Other effects may be obtained by mixing these, as forest green, which is too bright alone, mixed with walnut or some other reddish color gives a grayish green. Of the penetrating oil stains the golden oak and mahogany are very good.</p><p>The Sherwin Williams Company, of Cleveland, Newark, Chicago, etc., produce a fine line of spirit stains.</p></div> </div>
