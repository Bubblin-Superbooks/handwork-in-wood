<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Cross-Section Thru Back Left Leg and Adjoining Rails of Table. (Plan).<br>B. Elevation, Showing Wide Shoulder on Tenon of Rail.</p><p>Inasmuch as a drawer takes the place of a front rail, the front legs must be tied together in some other way. For this purpose two stringers or drawer rails may be used, their front edges being as far from the face of the legs as are the rails from the side and back. The upper drawer rail may be dovetailed at both ends into the tops of the legs, as shown in Fig. 292. If this takes more room than can well be spared from the depth of the drawer, it may be omitted, but it adds greatly to the stiffness of the table and is an excellent means of fastening on the top by the use of screws passing thru it.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The drawer rail, also called the fore edge, is long enough to partly overlap the side rails, into the lower edges of which it is gained so as to be flush with them,</p></div> </div>
