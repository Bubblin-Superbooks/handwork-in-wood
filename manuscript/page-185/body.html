<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">is a common mistake among beginners to let the cutter project too far.</p><p>It is important to know what is the best order of procedure in planing up a board. There are often reasons for omitting the planing up of one or more surfaces, but it is wise to form the habit of following a regular order, and the following is suggested as a good one:</p><blockquote><p>Working face. Plane one broad side flat and smooth. Finish with the plane set to cut line shavings. Test with try-square. Mark this face with a distinct pencil mark, A, Fig. 103.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Working edge. Plane one narrow side straight and square with the working face. Test with try-square, pressing the block of the try-square against the working face. Mark the working edge with two distinct pencil marks, B, Fig. 103.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>End.</blockquote></div> </div>
