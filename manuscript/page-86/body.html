<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">boards are carried to the trimmer, which cuts the length. The lumberman's rule is to "cut so that you can cut again." The so-called 16' logs are really 16' 6". The trimmer, Fig. 45, now trims these boards to 16' 1", so that if desired they can still be cut again. The trimmer may be set to cut at any desired length according to the specifications.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "70.88171780140976%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/handwork-in-wood/master/assets/images/042-400.png" /></div> </div>
