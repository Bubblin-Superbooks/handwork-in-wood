<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Hammers may be classified as follows: (1 hammers for striking blows only; as, the blacksmith's hammer and the stone-mason's hammer, and (2 compound hammers, which consist of two tools combined, the face for striking, and the "peen" which may be a claw, pick, wedge, shovel, chisel, awl or round head for other uses. There are altogether about fifty styles of hammers varying in size from a jeweler's hammer to a blacksmith's great straight-handled sledge-hammer, weighing twenty pounds or more. They are named mostly according to their uses; as, the riveting-hammer, Fig. 159, the upholsterer's hammer, Fig. 160, the veneering-hammer, Fig. 162, etc. Magnetized hammers, Fig. 161, are used in many trades for driving brads and tacks, where it is hard to hold them in place with the fingers. ) )</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Fig. 158.
