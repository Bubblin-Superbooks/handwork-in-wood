When the glue is dry, they are used as corners on which to clamp the handscrews. This method has the disadvantage that the blocks may break loose at a critical moment.</p><p>In addition to any of these methods of tightening the joints, to make sure that the ends of the joints close tight, pinch-dogs, Fig. 178,  , also driven into the ends, make the joint quite secure.</p><p><em>No. 53. A doweled miter</em> is one in which one or more dowels are inserted and glued into holes bored into the beveled edges.

A spline or tongue miter</em> is one which has a spline or tongue inserted at right angles to the joint. Since it furnishes more gluing surface, it is stronger than a plain miter.</p></div> </div>
